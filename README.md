# teestream
Redirect output to both a file and stdout/stderr

Built for Python 3.12, but should work for any Python >= 3.12

Inspired by TeeStream in [aws-encryption-sdk-python](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/blob/899af22c25fdd5d896817e40514b5ea0e1537e90/src/aws_encryption_sdk/internal/utils/streams.py#L4) and the `tee` POSIX command.
